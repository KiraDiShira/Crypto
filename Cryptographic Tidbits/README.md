## Codes vs chiphers

**Code**: mapping entire sentences to shorter words

**Cipher**: Character/symbol replacement. Do not involve meaning. Instead they are mechanical operations, known as algorithms, that are performed on individual or small chunks of letters. For example, in the Caesar Cipher we saw how each letter in the alphabet was mapped to a different letter: A=D,  B=E, and C=F, according to a specific shift, in this case three. This kind of cipher is known as a shift cipher
