## Codes vs chiphers

**Code**: mapping entire sentences to shorter words

**Cipher**: Character/symbol replacement. Do not involve meaning. Instead they are mechanical operations, known as algorithms, that are performed on individual or small chunks of letters. For example, in the Caesar Cipher we saw how each letter in the alphabet was mapped to a different letter: A=D,  B=E, and C=F, according to a specific shift, in this case three. This kind of cipher is known as a shift cipher

## Transposition vs substitution

In cryptography, a **substitution cipher** is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution.

Substitution ciphers can be compared with **transposition ciphers**. In a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.
